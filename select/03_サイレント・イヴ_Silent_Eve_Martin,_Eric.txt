Gently it falls
the white, white snow
Stop and stare at the scenery
Sounds in the street, the Christmas tree
I recall things we did long ago

Although time's been good to me
Very good to me
Been in and out of love
But why on this night so dear to me
You're not here, don't
know where you are

Although we said goodbye,
so many reasons why
But sometimes there are
reasons that you cannot see
Could not escape all my insecurity,
all around darkness over me

Promised to be just friends
but we know in the end
that's just a fantasy
that never will come true
Wanna let you know I won't
come between you two
I'll be strong I'll get over you

I believe deep in my heart
I can do what is right for me
Oh but I know I lose control,
sometimes love is a burden you bear

Think back all the memories,
things that used to be
I know I must be strong
Just as summer leads into the fall,
now it's time for me to move on

Although we said goodbye,
so many reasons why
But sometimes there are
reasons that you cannot see
A Christmas card, picture and memory
Even now they're calling out to me

Although I try to smile,
just for one day I cry
I know there's nothing
I can do to make it right
I know happiness
one day will return to me
Pray for me on this silent night

I know happiness
one day will return to me
Pray for me on this silent night
